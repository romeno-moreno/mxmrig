## How to
Unfortunately I'm not proficient at CMake, so building requires a lot of steps.
You have to use cmake to create *.xcodeproj (original cmake creates projects with absolute paths ðŸ˜ž). The generated project will be a macos command line app.
After manually converting it to iOS and fixing all build issues you'll be able to actually create a binary and run it on the device.
I would really appreciate if someone could fix the cmake file to generate iOS-compatible project out of the box!
